# leetui

A terminal-based interface for browsing, solving, and submitting LeetCode problems, built with **Rust** and **Ratatui**.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer (Please read before judging my code):** > This is 100% a personal hobby project. The codebase is heavily AI-generated, held together by duct tape and prayers, and exists solely because I wanted a convenient way to do LeetCode. It is _not_ a polished product built for promotion, and it's definitely not supposed to impress anyone.
> **A few crucial notes:**
>
> - Currently supports **Rust** and **Go** for scaffolding.
> - It proudly wears the "It Works On My Machine™" badge. Specifically, it has _only_ been tested with **Neovim (`nvim`) inside the Ghostty terminal**.
>
> If you want to use it, fork it, or fix it—you're more than welcome! Just don't expect enterprise-grade architecture.

## Features

- **Search** problems by name or number with instant results
- **Read** problem descriptions rendered directly in the terminal
- **Scaffold** a Rust or Go project with boilerplate for any problem, then open it in your editor
- **Run & Submit** code against LeetCode test cases without leaving the terminal
- **Personal Lists** synced with LeetCode -- browse, create, delete, and add problems
- **Stats** -- your solve counts right in the home screen
- Press `?` on any screen for all available keybindings

## Installation

### From crates.io

```bash
cargo install leetui

```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yottaes/leetui.git
cd leetui
cargo install --path .

```

### Shell wrapper (recommended)

When you scaffold a problem with `o`, the CLI opens your editor inside the problem directory. To auto-cd into that directory after exiting, add this to your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
lc() {
  local dir
  dir=$(leetui "$@")
  if [ -n "$dir" ] && [ -d "$dir" ]; then
    cd "$dir"
  fi
}

```

Then use `lc` instead of `leetui`. This is needed because a child process can't change its parent shell's working directory -- the wrapper captures the path printed to stdout and cd's into it.

Without the wrapper everything works the same, you just won't auto-cd after exiting.

## Authentication

The CLI reads your LeetCode session cookies directly from your browser (via the [rookie](https://crates.io/crates/rookie) crate). No manual token pasting needed.

On first launch you'll be prompted to log in. The app will attempt to extract cookies automatically. If that fails, it will open `leetcode.com/accounts/login` in your browser -- log in there, then press Enter to retry.

**macOS note:** Your OS may show a Keychain access prompt. Grant access so the app can read browser cookies.

| `d` / `u`   | Half page down / up         |
| `o`         | Scaffold & open in editor   |
| `r`         | Run code (sample cases)     |
| `s`         | Submit solution (all cases) |
| `a`         | Add to list                 |
| `b` / `Esc` | Back                        |

### Lists

| Key     | Action                       |
| ------- | ---------------------------- |
| `Enter` | Open list / View problem     |

| `d`     | Delete list / Remove problem |
| `Esc`   | Back                         |

## Configuration

Settings are stored in `~/.leetcode-cli/config.toml`. You can edit them from within the app by pressing `S`, or edit the file directly:

- **workspace_dir** -- where scaffolded projects are created (default: `~/leetcode`)
- **language** -- `rust` or `golang` (scaffolding support)
- **editor** -- command to open files (default: `nvim`)

## Contributing

This is a hobby project. That said:

- Feel free to **fork** the repo and do whatever you want with it
- PRs are welcome -- submit directly, no need to open an issue first
